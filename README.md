# PoE Currency grid
- All data is pulled from https://poe.ninja/challengehc/currency - this uses the latest data from Hardcore variant of the current PoE temporary league, "Incursion".
- As Chaos Orbs are most often used as a baseline, they are used as the base here. To show data past 100%, 50% is used instead of 100% for the Chaos Orb. So for all values relative to the Chaos Orb, they have been divided by 2 to reach the percentage relative to the Chaos Orb.
- To update this data automatically, I will likely need to parse raw stash tab data from the POE API.
